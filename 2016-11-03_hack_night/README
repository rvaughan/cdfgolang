Inaugural hack night.

Concept was to be able to take data from a public API, transform it somehow, and
then spit it out in a different format.

Not a lot to see here really, the app allows a query to be triggered against
the Companies House API (asynchronously) and then later on the results can be
retrieved.

The code is a little rough and ready, and is essentially written to try and
explain some underlying concepts such as channels to others. Try not to blind
yourself on the horrendous style and blatant errors, but we only had a couple
of hours. ;)
